    """Analyzes a given response from a guardrails check (e.g., content safety check or input check) and determines if the content is safe or not.

    The function operates based on the presence of certain keywords in the response:
    - If the response contains "safe", the content is deemed safe.
    - If the response contains "unsafe" or "yes", the content is deemed unsafe.
    - If the response contains "no", the content is deemed safe.

    Note: If you are using this function for a different task with a custom prompt, ensure to update the logic to match the new context.
    Here, "yes" implies the content should be blocked, is unsafe, or violates a policy, while "no" implies the content is safe or does not violate any policy.


    For example, in the `self_check_facts` action, we have a different interpretation.
    Here, "yes" indicates the content is safe. This is against the default logic of the `is_content_safe` function.
    Therefore, we invert the result of `is_content_safe` to align with this interpretation.
    If `is_content_safe` returns `False` (content is safe), `result` will be `0.0`. If `is_content_safe` returns `True` (content is unsafe), `result` will be `1.0`.
